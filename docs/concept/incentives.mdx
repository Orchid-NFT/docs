# Incentives

We want our NFTs to be a catalyst for actions, reminding you of the fragile nature of... nature. That why we targeted 2 groups for our project:

## NFT Holders

By letting the NFT change over time, owners of cards will become involved with their NFT and aid the NGOs that are maintaining nature parks, because the value of the NFT depends on them.
By connecting the financial world with the nature world, we create a shared bond and thus shared incentives.

## Governments

The data that we collect can be very beneficial for governments and allow them to desire which parks are in need of the most aid.
We are planning to make a leaderboard, where you can view the ranking of each park, filtered by country. 
With this info, governments can adjust budgets and aid those who need it the most.
