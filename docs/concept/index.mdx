The NFTs are based on the dynamic of nature.

Nature evolves over-time and we wanted to express this in the NFTs, so the image of an NFT will change over-time, depending on the circumstances the nature park is in.

The artwork on the NFT is decided by the nature park itself, but it needs to be able to change over-time in order to reflect changes.
